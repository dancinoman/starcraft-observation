# Starcraft Observation

**Description**: Starcraft observation answers to players' questions about which skills to focus on to get to the top. Video games are increasingly competitive nowadays, and data scientists can certainly participate in them.
The dataset has some flaws (complexity, missed values, etc....) And each steps are explained in my notebook on how I resolved those issues. In this project, I use a model to predict relevant features for each classification rank.</br></br>
